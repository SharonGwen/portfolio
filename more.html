                        <p> My Journey into web development began during my  studies when I look
                            a course on web technologies. I was immediately drawn to the creative
                            aspect of building websites and applications. Since then, I have
                            dedicated myself to learning the fundamentals of Front-End development.
                            I have also explored frameworks like React, which has further fueled
                            my enthusiasm for creating dynamic user interfaces.</p>

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <p> I leverage the latest technologies and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React,
                            to build dynamic interfaces that engage users and enhance their online experience. 
                            My approach combines creativity with technical expertise, ensuring that every project 
                            I undertake is both visually appealing and highly functional.</p>
